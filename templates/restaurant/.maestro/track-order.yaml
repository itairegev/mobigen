# Test orders screen and order tracking
- launchApp:
    clearState: true

# Navigate to Orders tab
- tapOn: "Orders"

# Initially should show no orders (empty state)
- assertVisible: "No orders yet"
- assertVisible: "Your order history will appear here"

# Note: Testing with actual orders would require:
# 1. Placing an order through checkout flow
# 2. Verifying it appears in active orders section
# 3. Tapping on an order to view details
# 4. Verifying order status, items, and summary
# This test validates the empty state of the orders screen
