# Test: Product Detail View
# Validates navigation to product details and viewing product information

- launchApp:
    clearState: true

# Navigate to Shop tab
- tapOn: "Shop"
- assertVisible:
    id: "search-input"

# Tap on first product
- tapOn:
    id: "product-1"

# Note: Based on code review, product detail screen navigation exists
# but we need to verify what's displayed. Since the template only shows
# tabs in current implementation, this will test the tap action works
# and navigation is properly configured

# For now, verify tap works and no crash occurs
- waitForAnimationToEnd

# If product detail screen exists, it should show product info
# This is a placeholder that will work once product/[id].tsx is implemented
