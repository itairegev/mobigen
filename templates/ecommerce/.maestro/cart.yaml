# Test: Shopping Cart Operations
# Validates cart functionality including quantity updates and item removal
# Note: This test assumes products can be added to cart from product detail screen
# Since current implementation may not have product detail screen yet,
# this test documents the expected cart behavior

- launchApp:
    clearState: true

# Navigate to Cart tab
- tapOn: "Cart"

# Verify empty cart state
- assertVisible: "Your cart is empty"
- assertVisible: "Add some products to get started"
- assertVisible:
    id: "browse-products-button"

# Test browse products button
- tapOn:
    id: "browse-products-button"

# Should navigate to Shop tab
- assertVisible: "Shop"
- assertVisible:
    id: "search-input"

# Return to cart
- tapOn: "Cart"
- assertVisible: "Your cart is empty"

# Note: Full cart testing (add to cart, update quantity, remove items)
# requires product detail screen with "Add to Cart" functionality
# Those tests should be added once that screen is implemented
